The time capsule project is where user can upload their memories
to get them after certain period of time. 
For example: If a user wants to get his current family picture on his 50th
birthday, the user just have to upload and set the date when the user wants the memory.

-> we support long time period for example after 5years, 20 years, etc.
-> Technology used:
    >For registerting the new user and create capusule I am using
     Express server to accept the request.
    >Right now the registerting and creting the new capsule and user
     is not hosted online.
    >But for delivering the memories I am using AWS services like
     lambda(for sending the memories) and EventScheduler(For longtime scheduling)
    >The deliver process is entirely serverless.
